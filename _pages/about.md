I am currently a graduate student pursuing MS in Computer Science at [University of Georgia, Athens](https://www.uga.edu/). I am a member of the [Heterogeneous Robotics(HeRo) Lab](http://hero.uga.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Ramviyas Parasuraman](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~ramviyas/) on Robotic Perception. I am also working as Research Assistant at [Centre for Geospatial Research](http://cgr.uga.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Sergio Bernardes](http://cgr.uga.edu/index.php/about/sergio-bernardes/index.html).

My research interest broadly lies in the area of Machine Learning and Data Science. Specifically, I am interested in employing Deep Learning, Computer Vision and NLP techniques to solve the problems in robotics, healthcare and enterprise AI domains. 

Prior to joining UGA, I was a product engineer at [ezDI, India](https://www.ezdi.com/), where I was part of the team developing HIM Workflow solutions. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [Gujarat Technological University, Ahmedabad](https://www.gtu.ac.in/).

I have a passion to make things done and finding adventure everywhere I go.
