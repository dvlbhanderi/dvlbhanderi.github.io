- I am a graduate student pursuing MS in Computer Science at [University of Georgia, Athens](https://www.uga.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ramviyas Parasuraman](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~ramviyas/). I am a member of the [Heterogeneous Robotics(HeRo) Lab](http://hero.uga.edu/), working on Robotic Perception and Mapping.

- My research interest broadly lies around Machine Learning and Data Science. Specifically, I am interested in employing Deep Learning, Computer Vision and NLP techniques to solve the problems in Robotics, Healthcare and Enterprise AI domains.

- I'm also working as a Graduate Research Assistant at [Centre for Geospatial Research](http://cgr.uga.edu/), under the guidance of [Dr. Sergio Bernardes](http://cgr.uga.edu/index.php/about/sergio-bernardes/index.html). I have a passion to make things done and finding adventures everywhere I go.

- Prior to joining UGA, I was a product engineer at [ezDI, India](https://www.ezdi.com/), where I was part of the team developing HIM Workflow solutions. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [Gujarat Technological University, Ahmedabad](https://www.gtu.ac.in/).
